<h2>How to install?</h2>

Install all files, unzip. Open your browser (Chrome or Microsoft Edge) and click on extensions->manage extensions. Enable developer mode. In the new window, select "Load unpacked" and select your unzipped file. Scroll down to the "From other sources" section and make sure ENIS is enabled. Now open the extension drop-down window again and click on the eye next to ENIS.

<h2>How to use it?</h2>

Click on the extension and log in to your account (only on first launch). Wait 2-3 seconds and the quarter grades will appear on the page.

<h2>Important</h2>

After the first successful login to your account, your login, password and city are saved locally, which are filled in within a minute after opening the extension.

Also, to add your school to index.html, change the akb value in the school selection to your own, you can enter it in the format provided in the school management system.

The extension works by sending requests to api.enis2.ml
